We can do this by first running `apt-get update -y`{{execute}} to update our default dependencies. After this command finnishes run: 
`apt-get install -y cxxtest`{{execute}}

# Cloning the tutorial repo
Now that we've installed `CxxTest` we need to clone the tutorial repo we will work with during this tutorial this can be done by executing the following command: 
`git clone -b tutorial-start https://github.com/KallePettersson/devops-executable-tutorial.git`{{execute}}
